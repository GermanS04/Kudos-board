### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs prepared me for most of the project, it was really useful for creating the backend and connecting it with the frontend. Although I felt unprepared to complete the feature of creating new pages with the react-router-dom, but with enough research on the internet I did it without much trouble.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have thought more in detailed the responsiveness of the website when on phone, specifically my modal were I display the comments. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I notice that one of my peers for the comment section did a new page, I think I would like to try that because it has more space than doing it in a modal.
